# Compression Engines

OmniRoute compression is built around engine contracts. A mode can run one engine directly
(`caveman` or `rtk`) or a deterministic stacked pipeline that executes multiple engines in order.

## Modes

| Mode         | Engine path                        | Intended input                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `off`        | none                               | Exact prompt preservation                    |
| `lite`       | Caveman lite helpers               | Low-risk always-on cleanup                   |
| `standard`   | Caveman                            | Natural-language prompt condensation         |
| `aggressive` | Caveman + history/tool summarizers | Long chat sessions                           |
| `ultra`      | Caveman + pruning helpers          | Context-limit recovery                       |
| `rtk`        | RTK                                | Terminal, shell, build, test, and git output |
| `stacked`    | Pipeline, default `rtk -> caveman` | Mixed tool logs and prose, max savings       |

## Engine Registry

The registry lives in `open-sse/services/compression/engines/registry.ts`. Engines expose a shared
contract:

- `id`: stable engine id such as `caveman` or `rtk`
- `apply(text, config)`: legacy execution path used by stacked pipelines
- `compress(input, config)`: primary execution path returning text + stats
- `getConfigSchema()`: returns the JSON-Schema-like shape of valid config
- `validateConfig(config)`: returns `{ valid, errors[] }`

Registration uses `registerCompressionEngine(engine)` (or `registerEngine` for advanced cases),
which calls `assertValidEngine()` and `validateConfig(defaultConfig)` before accepting.
Use `unregisterCompressionEngine(id)` to remove an engine at runtime.

`strategySelector.ts` registers the built-in engines before compression runs. This lets preview,
runtime compression, stacked mode, tests, and future engines use the same execution path.

### MCP description compression (related)

A separate registry compresses MCP tool description metadata at registry-level — see
`open-sse/mcp-server/descriptionCompressor.ts` and [MCP-SERVER.md](../frameworks/MCP-SERVER.md). It reuses
Caveman rules but operates on tool metadata, not request payloads.

## Caveman

Caveman mode focuses on semantic condensation of normal prose:

- preserves code blocks, URLs, JSON, paths, and structured data
- removes filler, hedging, repeated context, and verbose connective phrasing
- supports language-aware file rule packs in `open-sse/services/compression/rules/`
- remains available through the legacy `standard`, `aggressive`, and `ultra` modes

The dashboard surface is `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> Caveman`.

Caveman upstream reports `~75%` fewer output tokens, `65%` average output savings in benchmarks
with a `22-87%` range, and a `~46%` input-compression tool. OmniRoute uses the Caveman input-side
number when documenting stacked prompt/context savings; Caveman output mode remains a separate
response-behavior feature.

## RTK

RTK mode focuses on command and tool output:

- detects output classes such as `git status`, `git branch`, `git diff`, Vitest/Jest/Pytest,
  Cargo/Go tests, TypeScript/Vite/Webpack builds, ESLint, npm audit/installs, Docker logs,
  shell `find`/`grep`, stack traces, and generic logs
- applies 49 JSON filters from `open-sse/services/compression/engines/rtk/filters/`
- supports the RTK-style declarative pipeline: ANSI stripping, replace, match-output short-circuit,
  strip/keep lines, per-line truncation, head/tail/max-line truncation, and on-empty fallback
- supports trust-gated project filters in `.rtk/filters.json` and global filters in
  `DATA_DIR/rtk/filters.json`
- strips ANSI sequences, progress noise, repeated lines, and unhelpful boilerplate
- preserves actionable failures, warnings, summaries, changed files, and tail context
- can optionally retain redacted raw output for recovery/debugging through authenticated management
  routes

The dashboard surface is `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> RTK`.

Operational details for custom filters, trust, verify, and raw-output recovery live in
[`RTK_COMPRESSION.md`](./RTK_COMPRESSION.md).

RTK upstream reports `60-90%` savings for command-output compression. Its README example shows a
30-minute Claude Code session going from `~118,000` tokens to `~23,900`, or `79.7%` saved.

## Stacked Pipelines

Stacked mode runs pipeline steps in order. The default is:

```txt
rtk -> caveman
```

Use this for coding-agent sessions where a prompt combines command output with human or assistant
prose. RTK reduces noisy tool logs first, then Caveman compresses remaining natural language.

Pipeline steps are configured with `stackedPipeline` in compression settings or through compression
combos.

When both engines reduce the same eligible payload, savings compound:

```txt
combined = 1 - (1 - RTK savings) * (1 - Caveman input savings)
average  = 1 - (1 - 0.80) * (1 - 0.46) = 89.2%
range    = 1 - (1 - 0.60..0.90) * (1 - 0.46) = 78.4-94.6%
```

## MCP Accessibility Tree Filter

The MCP accessibility-tree smart filter is a post-execution compression layer that runs on MCP
**tool results**, not on prompts or context. It targets the verbose accessibility-tree and browser
snapshot payloads returned by tools like Playwright, computer-use, and browser-automation MCP
servers.

### What it does

1. **Noise stripping** — removes empty generic/text entries (`- generic:`, `- text: ""`)
2. **Sibling collapse** — when ≥ `collapseThreshold` (default 30) consecutive lines are structural
   repeats, collapses them into the first `collapseKeepHead` (default 10) lines + a count summary +
   the last `collapseKeepTail` (default 5) lines
3. **Ref preservation** — `[ref=eXX]` anchors required by Playwright/computer-use are never touched
4. **Hard truncation** — if the text after collapse still exceeds `maxTextChars` (default 50,000),
   truncates with a navigation hint so the agent can continue working

### Engine location

```txt
open-sse/services/compression/engines/mcpAccessibility/
  index.ts            ← smartFilterText() entry point
  collapseRepeated.ts ← sibling-collapse algorithm
  constants.ts        ← DEFAULT_MCP_ACCESSIBILITY_CONFIG
```

### Configuration

Controlled by `compression.mcpAccessibility` in global settings (migration 056). Default config:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "maxTextChars": 50000,
  "collapseThreshold": 30,
  "collapseKeepHead": 10,
  "collapseKeepTail": 5,
  "minLengthToProcess": 2000
}
```

The filter is only applied to tool-result payloads whose `type` is `"text"` and whose length
exceeds `minLengthToProcess`. It does not affect prompt compression or request payloads.

### Expected savings

60–80% on browser snapshot tool results, depending on page complexity. The collapse algorithm
is O(n) in line count and adds negligible latency.

### This filter vs the compression engines above

| Aspect      | Caveman / RTK / Stacked   | MCP accessibility filter               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Target      | Request prompts / context | MCP tool results                       |
| Trigger     | Compression mode setting  | `compression.mcpAccessibility.enabled` |
| Scope       | All SSE messages          | Tool results only                      |
| Ref anchors | N/A                       | Preserved unconditionally              |

## Compression Combos

Compression combos are named compression profiles that can be assigned to routing combos:

- `compression_combos`: stores mode, pipeline, RTK config, language config, and default marker
- `compression_combo_assignments`: maps a compression combo to a routing combo
- runtime integration resolves an assigned compression combo before generic combo overrides
- analytics include `compression_combo_id` and `engine`

Dashboard surface: `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> Compression Combos`.
